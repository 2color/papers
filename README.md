# IPFS Papers

> IPFS Papers (not specs)

This is a repository with academic papers on IPFS. None of these are published on any journal yet, but once IPFS operates at scale we can do that.

For papers that you can read to understand IPFS and the underlying technologies, go to [ipfs/reading-list](https://github.com/ipfs/reading-list).

This repo is primarily the work of @jbenet -- if you're interested in pursuing academic publishing of IPFS, parts of it, or relates systems, get in touch. There is a large constellation of research to be done around IPFS.

~~ this repo is hibernating until @jbenet gets time to work on it ~~
